# 275Project
We will be expanding off of our previous project and making it more complex. We will stick with the idea of a purchasing and discount system but with more conditions on what the value of purchases are and how they affect the users totals. We will design a program that will keep track of a user's purchases, miles driven, and amount of gas needed throughout a trip. We will display this data to the user so that they may choose the best route and place to stop.
